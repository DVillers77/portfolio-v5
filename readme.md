# Portfolio: The V25 High-Fidelity Rig

A professional interface engineered at the intersection of mathematical rigor and atmospheric depth. This project
showcases a custom-calibrated CSS engine designed to demonstrate the "Physics of UX."

## 🔄 The V25 Architectural Evolution

Transitioned from localized styling to a **Mathematical Gauge System**. The rig now operates on a unified 1.414 harmonic
scale.

### Key Architectural Breakthroughs:

- **Steady Flood Engine:** A Houdini-powered (`@property`) lighting system that eliminates color banding and provides a
  living UI depth without performance regression.
- **The Spinal Tap Gauge:** A spacing engine derived from an 80px/48px base unit, ensuring every "void" on the page is a
  calculated product of the system.
- **The Chrome-Tab Handshake:** A structural navigation rig utilizing "Orange Wedge" corner extrusions to bridge active
  tabs into the background, functioning as a physical page label.

## 🚀 The Build Environment

- **Logic:** Mobile-First, BEM Methodology, Token-driven CSS.
- **Typography:** 1.414 Augmented Fourth Scale (Poppins/Inter).
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA calibrated, APCA-aware contrast, and 44px touch-target protocols.

## ⚠️ Development Note: Structural Integrity

This project utilizes a **Rigid Constraint** approach. Complex layout logic—such as the "Chrome Tab" navigation
brackets—is protected by fixed CSS anchors to ensure brand updates do not cause regression in the core "Wedge" geometry.
