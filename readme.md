# Portfolio: UX-Driven Engineering

A professional portfolio showcasing the intersection of robust front-end architecture and semantic UX design. Built with a focus on **Material 3 (M3)** logic and **CSS Houdini** atmospheric effects.

## 🔄 The V24 Architectural Refactor
Currently transitioning from a localized workflow to a **Tokenized Design System**.

### Key Technical Achievements:
- **Atmospheric Pulse:** A performant, Houdini-powered radial lighting system that eliminates color banding and provides a living UI feel.
- **Syntax Branding:** A brand identity (`Dave's`) that utilizes coding syntax to reinforce the developer persona, integrated without breaking complex flexbox alignments.
- **Semantic Hierarchy:** Optimized typography scale for 100% legibility across all viewports, resolving mobile header/quote competition.

## 🚀 Technical Stack
- **Architecture:** Mobile-First, BEM Methodology, Token-driven CSS.
- **Design:** M3 Tonal Palette, Inter/Poppins Typography.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG AA Contrast, 44px touch targets, and ARIA-compliant navigation.

## ⚠️ Development Note: Stability First
This project utilizes a **Surgical Refactor** approach. Complex layout logic (such as the "Chrome Tab" navigation brackets) is protected by rigid CSS constraints, ensuring brand updates do not cause regression in core structural features.
